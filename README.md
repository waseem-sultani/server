Express.js Mini Issues Board app

## All of the code is in main branch, clone the repository through the HTTP or SSH key and take the pull of main branch.

I am using MongoDb Atlas to make others free from setting up the dev environment. Just add the Mongo URI in the env and project is ready to run.
After setting up the env run npm i to install the node modules and the npm run dev to run the dev server.
